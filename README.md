# Breast-Cancer-prediction
---
In this project we are goinig to use the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to preddict the breast cancer, that is whether it is a Malignant or benign.


## Breast cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

### Data Set Characteristics :

```:Number of Instances :  569
  :Number of Attribute :  30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class`
  
:Attribute Information:
- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
```
